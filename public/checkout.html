            <div class="w3-xlarge g u w3-center high">Here's The Moral Of The Story...</div>
            <p class="w3-medium">I started Kite Developers earlier in 2020.<br><br>
                I felt frustrated with how much misinformation was being taught about
                marketing and the right way of taking a business forward ethically.<br><br>
                Misinformation that’s complex, and incomplete, money draining,
                result-less.<br><br>
                Long story, short…<br><br>
                I spent a lot of months trying to make my first online sales. No joke.<br><br>
                It was brutal. And painful. And also, unnecessary.<br><br>
                Tell me, does any of this sound familiar?<br><br>
                ...I bought every “tripwire”...<br><br>
                ...opted-in for every ebook...<br><br>
                ...watched all the webinars…<br><br>
                ...and even purchased some pricey “business development courses”.<br><br>
                None of it worked.<br><br>
                Why?<br><br>
                Because they were all different “new age,fundamental-less” approaches.<br><br>
                I fell for the “shiny object syndrome” I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
                My desire to improve my marketing abilities was always bigger than my
                lack of knowledge as to HOW to do it most effectively.<br><br>
                Because of those painful experiences...<br><br>
                I’ve been where you may be right now.<br><br>
                I’ve known that struggle.<br><br>
                I’ve felt that frustration.<br><br>
                I’ve been lost in that confusion.<br><br>
                It took me a long time to understand the power of my own words and
                memes and all that they could accomplish.<br><br>
                Then all of this changed, when I rushed into my office and searched
                vigorously for an old pendrive which had over 1000 ads published by the
                greatest of the great copywriters and marketers of all time.<br>
                SO. FINALLY THE MAGIC HAPPENED..<br>
                I decided to study the ads, understand the actual pain points and give them
                a new touch that is suitable to this generation.<br><br>
                After thinking for endless nights, i finally figured out that if i could tell my
                message to the world using memes and in a funny way, I would earn the
                most expensive currency in the world i.e. ATTENTION As I mentioned
                earlier very easily..<br>
                Once that was done with a little solid follow up methods I could close upon
                all the deals that came my way and finallyyyyyyyy made sales ONLINE!</p><br>

                    You see, the value of this collection of meme ads and training isn’t on the

                Yes. And sometimes no.<br><br>
                And at exactly that point is a do-or-die decision for online businesses.<br><br>
                You see, we as marketers and advertisers, have all the power and skill to

                But we’re wrong. We can’t fool any of the people any of the time.<br><br>
                We’re a nation of smart people.<br><br>
                And most smart people ignore most digital scarcity tactics because most
                digital scarcity tactics ignore smart people.<br><br>
                So we try new tricks. New gimmicks.<br><br>
                A new trick and a new gimmick are one in the same.<br><br>
                And above all, the digital scarcity we add to our sales copy must be the
                truth.<br><br>

            Here’s the great news for you:<br><br>
            Fate dealt you a nice hand here by landing you on “Test A"...<br><br>

                Because I’m also going to be testing the price points of each additional ad
                collection as well.<br><br>
                If you’re feeling inspired to invest in your marketing ability, this is your
                moment of truth.<br><br>
                And, if you need help right with other problems that I faced in my journey,
                select the other blueprints as much as you want...<br><br>
                .. if isn't feasible for you right now, start with what is.<br><br>
                <span class="g">If that means 2 collections, start with 2.<br><br></span>
                <span class="g">If that means 12 collections, go with 12.<br><br></span>
                The value you receive increases proportionately.<br><br>
                And regardless, starting with the Meme Marketing collection is absolutely
                PERFECT place for every marketer to start.<br><br>
