            <div class="w3-xlarge g u w3-center">Here's The Moral Of The Story...</div>
            <p class="w3-medium">I started Kite Developers earlier in 2020.<br><br>
                I felt frustrated with how much misinformation was being taught about
                marketing and the right way of taking a business forward ethically.<br><br>
                Misinformation that’s complex, and incomplete, money draining,
                result-less.<br><br>
                Long story, short…<br><br>
                I spent a lot of months trying to make my first online sales. No joke.<br><br>
                It was brutal. And painful. And also, unnecessary.<br><br>
                Tell me, does any of this sound familiar?<br><br>
                ...I bought every “tripwire”...<br><br>
                ...opted-in for every ebook...<br><br>
                ...watched all the webinars…<br><br>
                ...and even purchased some pricey “business development courses”.<br><br>
                None of it worked.<br><br>
                Why?<br><br>
                Because they were all different “new age,fundamental-less” approaches.<br><br>
                I fell for the “shiny object syndrome” I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
                My desire to improve my marketing abilities was always bigger than my
                lack of knowledge as to HOW to do it most effectively.<br><br>
                Because of those painful experiences...<br><br>
                I’ve been where you may be right now.<br><br>
                I’ve known that struggle.<br><br>
                I’ve felt that frustration.<br><br>
                I’ve been lost in that confusion.<br><br>
                It took me a long time to understand the power of my own words and
                memes and all that they could accomplish.<br><br>
                Then all of this changed, when I rushed into my office and searched
                vigorously for an old pendrive which had over 1000 ads published by the
                greatest of the great copywriters and marketers of all time.<br>
                SO. FINALLY THE MAGIC HAPPENED..<br>
                I decided to study the ads, understand the actual pain points and give them
                a new touch that is suitable to this generation.<br><br>
                After thinking for endless nights, i finally figured out that if i could tell my
                message to the world using memes and in a funny way, I would earn the
                most expensive currency in the world i.e. ATTENTION As I mentioned
                earlier very easily..<br>
                Once that was done with a little solid follow up methods I could close upon
                all the deals that came my way and finallyyyyyyyy made sales ONLINE!</p><br>
